### Live site at [NoteTakerWithHeroku](https://afternoon-lake-66765.herokuapp.com/)
​
​For this project I created the backend code for saving notes for a predesigned note taking site. I used Heroku to host the site and Express with .get and .push commends to allow for data pulls.  

## Key Features
* back end hosted on Heroku
* unique IDs generated for tasks using npm Uniqid
* landing page and notes page load from server
saved notes load on left side of page upon page open or note save
notes are saved in JSON
